This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue in VBScript related to the `IsEmpty` function's behavior with Variants.  The `bug.vbs` file shows a function that attempts to handle optional arguments, but incorrectly uses `IsEmpty` which leads to unexpected results. The solution in `bugSolution.vbs` demonstrates how to use `IsNumeric` and `TypeName` for better handling of optional parameters.
